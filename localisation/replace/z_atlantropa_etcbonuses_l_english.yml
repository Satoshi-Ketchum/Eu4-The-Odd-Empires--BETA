However, admist the chaos, a prince of the Japanese royal family seems to have escaped, and have taken to staging a guerilla war against us, throughout the country. They, and their supporters, have declared themselves to be the Yokai, and have already formed cells throughout Japan. However, they have been unable to protect the Chrysanthemum Throne, upon which Japanese Emperors have sat since the 7th century.

 agmajongpa.25.t:0"The New Way of Life"
 agmajongpa.25.d:0"Now that the Agmajongpa has secured its rule over China, the time has come to begin the process of integrating the Chinese into our traditions. We shall start with the North, and we shall move Southwards with time. Soon, Hangul will be taught in all corners of the world."
 agmajongpa.25.a:0"In due time, all of China will know we are here."
 agmajongpa.26.t:0"Secrets of China"
 agmajongpa.26.d:0"China is broken. From the North in Beijing, to the South in Nanjing, and all in between, the Agmajongpa reigns supreme. We have gained much from this conversion, and we shall ensure that we can take these lessons to heart."
 agmajongpa.26.a:0"Commit the process to text, and secure the records in Agmaui Jali."
 agmajongpa.26.b:0"The Cheonma will devote time to this personally."
 agmajongpa.27.t:0"India Subdued"
 agmajongpa.27.d:0"India is vast and diverse, we cannot hope to govern it effectively, let alone integrate it as we did China. We can, however, aim to split the local princes and states against eachother, giving power to those who side with us, and ensuring that the subcontinent is loyal, even if it is never fully integrated into the sect."
 agmajongpa.27.a:0"We will continue our rule unaltered."
 agmajongpa.27.b:0"We will split the beast into a thousand pieces, never to unite again."
 agmajongpa.28.t:0"Indochina Subdued"
 agmajongpa.28.d:0"Indochina, the frontier of culture between India and China, has been conquered. The region, rich in trade, will surely help our merchants draw wealth from our empire into the core of our nation."
 agmajongpa.28.a:0"The Cheonma's will fulfilled."
 agmajongpa.29.t:0"Deadland Wonderland"
 agmajongpa.29.d:0"Our conquests are met with blood and fire. Cities burn, and the lives of a great many of our enemies are extinguished. That is, of course, the norm, in the far North, we are met only with silence and cold, the depths of which seemingly know no bounds. The birth of an isolationist culture in the North has begun, as the frozen wastes block most news from the court in Agmajongpa. Here, a modest life is liveable, if barely, away from the brutality and conquest."
 agmajongpa.29.a:0"A great conquest, but for what? A nice fur hat? ...With that said, it is a nice hat. The Cheonma will surely be pleased."
# After digging for weeks, the disciples have finally reported success. Inside the tomb, they have unearthed a wide variety of treasures, and no small amount of skeletons. It seems those who dug the tomb were forced into it too, and the doors to the tomb were full of a great many scratch marks. Further into the tomb, we have found a manuscript, that seems to contain the strategies and musings of Genghis!
 #monuments The area was an unmarked ridge, known only to us by the torture of several members of the Borjigin family.

 ATALNTROPASWORD:0"Legacy of the Hundred Thousand Sword War"
 ATALNTROPASWORD_DESC:0"The Hundred Thousand Sword war was fought between Korea and the Agmajongpa, or Demonic Sect. The war ultimately ended in a stalemate, with the Murim union, a league of martial artists, coming to control most of Korea, a concession from the ruling Yi dynasty to prevent the complete conquest of Korea by the Agmajongpa. Now, Mount Hwa, and the Namgung Clan have both asserted their autonomy from the Murim union, whilst the Yi dynasty rules only over a small chunk of land outside of Gyeongbok Palace. Time will tell who will emerge from the war on top, but whatever the case, more blood will be spilt."

 atl_bonusevent.1.t:"The Last Mammoth Hunt"
 atl_bonusevent.1.d:"Unlike in other regions of the world, the Vinlandic mammoth lived relatively undisturbed from humans. Prior that is, to the arrival of Norse settlers to the island. However, as of late, the increasing demand for ivory, centered around the city of Vinterfell, have caused the final extinction of the creature on the island. Recently, the last mammoth known to live was hunted down, and it seems the mammoths long existence has finally been ended by humanity."
