 desc_carrion_reanimation_aspect:0 "Whilst it is often considered to reanimate the dead of humans, or humanoids, little is considered the usefullness of those of other species. By reanimating bats, or on the surface, birds, we can establish a truly frightening auxilliary to our traditional forces."

 atl_ktonian.1.d:0"Carrion Reanimation is the process of securing flying creatures to prepare a flying auxiliary for our armies. The process involves dousing the creatures in properly prepared vats of reagants, and infusing them with dark energies. Proper specimens are recently dead, and made of barely damaged carcasses. However, a cheaper alternative would be to simply pay local hunters a small amount of money to secure more damaged ones, though they would last for a shorter period."
 atl_ktonian.1.a:0"Just use whatever we can find."

 atl_ktonian.3.t:0"§PDark Ritual§! §W-§! §YDust to Dust§!"
 atl_ktonian.3.d:0"To commit stone to ashes is a simple spell, it involves using a variety of technological reagants spread onto rocks or cannonballs, that are then fired at the walls of the enemy. These react with the stone in a matter of hours, and result in the walls crumbling before our armies. This is however, costly, and will prevent us from doing other rituals for awhile."
 atl_ktonian.3.a:0"Ashes to Ashes."
 atl_ktonian.4.t:0"§PDark Ritual§! §W-§! §YNecronomics§!"
 atl_ktonian.4.d:0"Utilizing our undead to farm and harvest resources has long been discussed, with the primary arguments against it being the difficulty to get undead to follow complicated commands, and the weakening of our military. So too is there a problem of disease and unemployment. However, with proper reserach and time put into reanimating proper undead for menial labor, they can be specialized somewhat into working jobs that do not involve killing. These measures will not last forever however, but should provide a measure of economic growth in the short term."

 atl_ktonian.8.d:0"When those who came before us in the caves left it, they left behind many vats of powerful super soldiers. By reanimating these soldiers, we can produce powerful generals to serve us. However, their nature as super soldiers makes them hard to control, and therefore it is necessary to exercise caution when dealing with them."
 atl_ktonian.8.a:0"A powerful, if hard to control, general."
 atl_ktonian.9.t:0"§BCommuning With Olms§!"
 atl_ktonian.9.d:0"Communing with the Olms is a sacred act performed by the Shamans of our people. They first grind up a set of regents, made from several mushroom species that grow naturally in the Undermu. These regents attract the attention of a Great Olm, who is then swayed with various gifts and feasts into providing wisdom unto our people. These Great Olms beneath the Earth have commanded us for time untold, it was under their guidance that we invaded the surface world, and pushed the Pale Ones out of the rails. They will surely guide us to even greater riches and power should we continue our conquests!"

 agarthan_squares: "Agarthan Squares"
 agarthan_troglodytes: "Troglodyte Slaves"
 agarthan_troglodyte_warslaves: "Troglodyte Warslaves"

 agarthan_scoutsDESCR: "Scouts of the various human polities of the depths rely on hit and run tactics, wearing minimal armor and focusing mostly on using spears and short swords. Bows and slings never saw great use outside of sieges, due to the close nature of cave combat, making them a costly endeavour most armies could not afford, due to the large lack of good wood and leather."
 agarthan_light_infantryDESCR: "Shields and better armor create a force with greater staying power than the scouts typically used, as well as protect from the new crossbow."
 agarthan_light_crossbowsDESCR: "Missile weapons never saw widespread use in the caverns, due to the darkness and poor sight of cave dwellers. However, with the invention of the easier to aim crossbow, the problem has been somewhat mitigated, and with crossbows being able to be made of metal, they are far easier to produce."
 agarthan_infantryDESCR: "Cave dwelling infantry has further adapted to the prescence of ranged weaponry, and has developed stronger armor and shields to protect from more powerful crossbows."
 agarthan_crossbowsDESCR: "With more powers utilizing crossbows, crossbow soldiers have been forced to adopt stronger armor to protect themselves, as well as more powerful crossbows to puncture stronger armor."
 agarthan_heavy_infantryDESCR: "With larger nations under the Earth than ever, and even more powerful crossbows, armor is even more widely available, and in good qualities as well. Heavy Infantry focused on taking hits and getting into close range has developed as a strategy to break crossbow formations."
 agarthan_heavy_crossbowsDESCR: "The Heavy Crossbow is a true miracle of innovation, capable of piercing through the toughest steel, and shooting more accurately than ever, through even the use of primitive scopes."
 agarthan_ironwallsDESCR: "Ironwalls are perhaps the most elite and heavy infantry to exist on the planet, let alone the caves. The invention of gunpowder weapons has resulted in the development of large iron shields capable of creating bulletproof walls to advance on enemy lines, but the writing for heavy infantry is on the walls in the caves, and it is only a matter of time before guns advance to be able to pierce through them as well."
 agarthan_blindsidersDESCR: "The invention of gunpowder weapons has allowed the puncturing of the heavy armor commonly in use before their development, allowing a new form of light infantry to be created, capable of easily blindsiding even the toughest and most elite heavy infantry, through clever and daring flanking maneuvers through caves."
 agarthan_cave_volleysDESCR: "Cave Volleys have emerged following the destruction of the heavy infantry model of underground combat. They are focused around delivering volleys of fire into eachother until one side breaks, often creating trenches of bodies in caves."
 agarthan_lineDESCR: "The Agarthan Line has developed following the start of the conquest of the surface by Agarthan forces. They are focused around line combat, aiming to create similar situations to the cave volleys of old, such to allow the poor eyesight of the cave dwellers to matter less, as volleys of fire from lines care not if fifty bullets out of a hundred miss."
 agarthan_darkcoatsDESCR: "Darkcoats are named suchly due to their distinctive dark coats, made out of various cave materials before being shipped to the surface. Often used in a derogatory sense, to seperate them from their more brightly colored surface counterparts, the name has been embraced in a manner by the soldiers, who envoke a reputation of terror on the surface."
 agarthan_westernized_lineDESCR: "The Agarthan Lines were powerful formations, but their focus on recreating cave warfare ultimately made them flawed in a world of more open surface combat. The Westernization of the lines aims to address this, and has led to the continued success of Agartha in military matters."
 agarthan_squaresDESCR: "Agarthan Squares are focused on breaking cavalry charges and on quick maneuverability, in a matter similar to the Napoleonic square."
 agarthan_troglodytesDESCR: "Troglodytes are huge, stupid beings of great strength. They resemble humanoid lizards, the size of elephants, and have been widely enslaved by all inhabitants of the caves beneath Mu. The beasts can throw boulders to break city walls, but are far too scared to be usefully used in battle unarmoured."
 agarthan_troglodyte_warslavesDESCR: "With additional resources being made available once more from larger empires, Troglodytes can now be somewhat armored and even in rare cases armed with primitive grenades, greatly improving their effectiveness in battle."
 
 #Pale One Units
 paleone_t: "Pale One"
 pale_ones: "Pale Ones"
 pale_onesDESCR: "Pale Ones are slow, lumbering humans who have been heavily mutated by years of working in Great Hwan slave pits, they once held sway over all the caves, before being pushed back by the Agarthans. Now, they worship the relics left behind by the Great Hwan, unaware of their history as a slave race to the very Gods they worship."
 pale_one_warriors: "Pale One Warriors"
 pale_one_warriorsDESCR: "The slow and traditional nature of Pale One militaries has rendered them quite unadaptable to new forms of military. Pale Ones traditionally fought naked, with spears, but recent reforms have led to a more armored warrior being developed."
 cavern_guard: "Cavern Guard"
 cavern_guardDESCR: "Cavern Guards were once an elite unit, one of the few armored regiments the Pale Ones had. Now, they make up the bulk of Pale One armies, and are well drilled and organized to bring war to mankind."
 pale_line: "Pale Line"
 pale_lineDESCR: "Lines of Pale Ones, capable of devastating enemy charges with firepower, though lack in their ability to counter charge."
 pale_square: "Pale Square"
 pale_squareDESCR: "Pale Ones arranged into squares, due to their lack of cavalry and inability to react fast enough to switch formations to avoid cavalry charges, this is the best formation for them on the surface."
 reformed_pale_square: "Reformed Pale Square"
 reformed_pale_squareDESCR: "Further reforms allow some level of mobility to come due to a more fluid structure."
 
 #Cavalry
 drake_rider: "Drake Rider"
 drake_riderDESCR: "Cave drakes are large scaled reptiles, which have for the longest time been impractical as cavalry due to their high maintenence nature. With larger empires being formed underground, they are now possible to be utilized as cavalry."
 reformed_drake_knights: "Cave Drake Knights"
 reformed_drake_knightsDESCR: "Cave drakes are large scaled reptiles, which have for the longest time been impractical as cavalry due to their high maintenence nature. With larger empires being formed underground, they are now possible to be utilized as cavalry. These cave drake riders are heavily armored, forming veritable tanks in our battlefields."
 drake_cuirassiers: "Drake Cuirassiers"
 drake_cuirassiersDESCR: "Cave drakes have a position in warfare as heavily armored shock troops, we just need to ensure they can reach the enemy, and then they will surely end any foe they reach."
 fleet_riders: "Fleet Riders"
 fleet_ridersDESCR: "Horses have significant advantages over cave drakes, with their fast nature being able to perform a more traditional role for our cavalry."
 mounted_drake_gunners: "Mounted Drake Gunners"
 mounted_drake_gunnersDESCR: "Cave drakes with large guns mounted to them enable us to influence the battlefield in a way that horses simply do not allow."

 #Ktonian Units
 ktonian_t: "Ktonian"
 ktonian_slave_mob: "Slave Mob"
 ktonian_slave_mobDESCR: "A mixture of slaves and undead organized into mobs, prodded forward by torture and threats. Not the most effective fighting force, but it is all we can manage without a full transition to undead."
 ktonian_slave_battalions: "Slave Battalions"
 ktonian_slave_battalionsDESCR: "The military reforms of the Agarthans have forced our hand, we need to organize our slaves slightly better. By granting more freedom to some of those who fight, we can better motivate them to fight, and equip them better with less risk."
 ktonian_slave: "Slave Soldiers"
 ktonian_slaveDESCR: "Further reforms by our enemies have forced us to give more of our slave soldiers partial freedom. The lack of a proper undead army is beginning to hamper our military efforts however, and research must be done into enforcing a full undead army."
 ktonian_warslaves: "Warslaves"
 ktonian_warslavesDESCR: "Agartha has oncemore reformed their military. Solid lines of shields and crossbows are a farcry from the old hit and run tactics of old. We need to look into working our military into a fully undead force. It cannot continue like this, with rumours of weapons capable of giving any man the ability to kill with ease, we must ensure they do not end up in the hands of our slaves. Our military can go no further than this while relying on the living. It is absolutely imperative that we reform, this cannot go on like this."
 #Undead Units
 ktonian_dead_t: "§PNecromantic§!"
 longdead_mob: "§PNecromantic§! Longdead Mob"
 longdead_mobDESCR: "Our initial experiments into undead are costly and time intensive endeavours. Each undead must be specially prepared for days to be fully reanimated, and the process results in a weak, decrepit shambler. We have taken to calling them longdead, in reference to this age. It is often weeks before an undead is ready to be sent to the battlefield."
 undead_troglodytes: "§PNecromantic§! Undead Troglodytes"
 undead_troglodytesDESCR: "Troglodytes are a prime specimen to be turned into undead, their large forms and humanoid stature enables a particularly devastating form of undead to be created. It is however, time consuming, and the resulting undead would not be better than a cannon, just as the living troglodytes were eventually replaced with cannons. They make excellent shock troops, able to support our forces with boulders when need be."
 
 skeletal_phalanx: "§PNecromantic§! Skeletal Phalanx"
 skeletal_crossbows: "§PNecromantic§! Skeletal Crossbows"
 skeletal_arquebusier: "§PNecromantic§! Skeletal Arquebusiers"
 skeletal_blindsiders: "§PNecromantic§! Skeletal Blindsiders"
 skeletal_volley: "§PNecromantic§! Skeletal Volley"
 skeletal_line: "§PNecromantic§! Skeletal Line"
 skincoats: "§PNecromantic§! Skincoats"
 skeletal_phalanxDESCR: "Skeletons most closely resemble living armies, with their ability to manipulate more complicated weaponry. They make for excellent phalanx, with the almost immunity to being stabbed back, due to a lack of flesh, they can be turned into effective fighting formations. Whilst forcing the enemy back with spears, they are able to take almost no hits in return, except for crossbow bolts, which have proven effective, but nothing that shield cannot stop."
 skeletal_crossbowsDESCR: "Further refinement of our skeleton creation technique has allowed them to grasp and utilize crossbows. This provides an interesting strategic opportunity, as skeletons are able to sense the living far better in the caves than the darksight of the average cave dweller. This has let them strike from further away than traditional crossbows, forcing our enemy to fight on our terms."
 skeletal_arquebusierDESCR: "With  the invention of primitive gunpowder weapons, no other country has adopted them as fast as we have, our skeletons prove great marksmen when compared to the lacking eyesight of the cave dwellers. Their ability to sense the living has turned them into true sharpshooters, even with their unwieldy weapons."
 skeletal_blindsidersDESCR: "The Blindsiders of the Agarthans, focused on quickly repositioning to flank enemy positions in the caves, are a form of infantry that we can adapt rather easily to skeletons. Through clever utilization of these formations, we can easily surround and destroy the more slow human armies."
 skeletal_volleyDESCR: "Skeletons, with proper preparations, are able to do monotonous tasks quite easily, and with great efficiency. This has enabled true volley fire, each skeleton firing precisely as the last is finished, to be possible in a way that it is simply not for mortal armies. Whilst they might claim to hold a true discipline and order in their volleys, when met with the constant firing of our guns, they will surely break and rout."
 skeletal_lineDESCR: "With our emergence unto the surface, the older techniques of stuffing a cave with as many rifles as possible, and volley firing has become less feasible. We have therefore developed line formations, aiming to create similar situations to our old style of combat."
 skincoatsDESCR: "Skincoats are suchly called due to their human skin coats, sewn to inspire fear and horror into our enemies. They hold a matchless discipline and an unending ability to fire until they have all died. The pinnacle of undead combat has truly been reached."
 
 undead_mob: "§PNecromantic§! Undead Mob"

 undead_wall: "§PNecromantic§! Ironwalls of Undead"
 undead_horrors: "§PNecromantic§! Undead Horrors"
 undead_abominations: "§PNecromantic§! Abominations"
 undead_mobDESCR: "Our experiments into undead have enabled us to more quickly reanimate the dead, and have led to the development of two schools of thought, that of a skeleton based army, and that of relying on the old tactics of swarms. Whilst some might call for the adoption of a skeletal army to better fit the ideals of modern warfare, with less negatives, it is a far more practical solution to simply arrange our undead into mobs, and overwhelm any living formations. They might not be a traditional soldier, but undead should not be treated as traditional soldiers."
 undead_hordeDESCR: "Further experiments have enabled us to refine the undead creation process further, with them now forming even greater numbers, and with even greater savagery and ferocity."
 flaming_hordeDESCR: "Our enemies have developed sturdy plate and heavy armour, it is therefore necessary to adapt our military strategy to fit this change in their thoughts. By dousing our undead in gasoline, we can throw them unto heavily armored soldiers and cook them in their suits, rendering them useless."
 tanning_hordeDESCR: "With the development of even stronger crossbows and even guns, we have discovered a method to increase our undead's ability to resist bullets. By using tanning and other chemicals, we can turn their skin into a leather on their bodies, enabling them to resist wounds of gun and crossbow alike."
 undead_wallDESCR: "Further development of weaponry has led to our undead no longer being able to shrug off enemy fire with hardened skin. We have therefore prepared a solution of utilizing large metal shields to protect our undead, and then slowly closing the distance and running the enemies out of fire, in a matter similar to the Ironwalls of the Agarthans."
 undead_horrorsDESCR: "With strong defenses being no longer a feasible way to approach enemy formations, we are forced to research further into our creation of undead. By manipulating the dead into grotesque forms, with the addition of animal parts and various weapons sewn into their forms, we can create true horros able to cross the battlefield in far less time, and deal far more damage on their arrival. They are however, rather vulnerable to enemy fire, so a quick engagement is often created."
 undead_abominationsDESCR: "Further development into the manipulation of the dead have created true abominations, large hulking bodies sewn from various sources, swift undead resembling the centaurs of myth, and even horrifying flying undead. The pinnacle of undead combat has truly been reached."
