 fjordland_doggish_desc:0 "Doggerland has a fantastic position when it comes to fishing in the North Sea. By investing in local fishermen, we can expand the economy of these otherwise rugged islands."
 fjordland_thule_desc:0 "We have arrived at Ultima Thule! A land draped in mystery and legend, populated by godless heathens. It will serve as the center of our new maritime empire, but before we can launch further expeditions we will have to deal with the locals."
