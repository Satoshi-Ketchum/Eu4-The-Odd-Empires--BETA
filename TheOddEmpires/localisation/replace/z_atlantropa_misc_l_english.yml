Our military leaders are inspired by those achievements."

  holy_father_desc:0 "Being the Vicar of God to Roman Chalcedonians gives us a certain amount of political leeway. The Papal Bull, documents carrying the Pope's official seal, carry the weight of the very word of God. With these rulers have been cursed and entire continents divided. "
  cuius_regio_eius_religio_desc:0 "Both Chalcedonian and Solar German lords have an exclusive right to control religious matters in their demesnes according to the principle 'Whose realm, his religion'."
  swiss_tolerance_desc:0 "The Reformation threatens to tear our land apart. Some provinces join the Solar movement, others Reform, and still others remain Chalcedonian. Our land is ravaged by violence and confusion. Why must we kill each other over transubstantiation and predestination when we could turn our mountain home into a realm united once more?"

 breton_catholicism_desc:0 "The French may have claimed to be the 'eldest daughter of the Church' since the days of Clovis, but their observance is spotty and their fealty to Rome only evident when it suits them. The Breton doesn't hide his veneration of the Blessed Virgin or his loyalty to the teachings of His Holiness and the one true Chalcedonian Church."
 catholicon:0 "The Chalcedonianon"
 catholicon_desc:0 "In 1464, Jehan Lagadeuc wrote the first trilingual dictionary, which contained words in Latin, Breton, and French.

 heretic_teachings_desc:0 "Ever since the early middle ages Bosnia has been a safe haven for all kinds of heretics. Accepted and largely left to themselves in the remote hinterlands of Bosnia, these small groups thrived into communities and entire monasteries, bringing forgotten and mysterious knowledge from all over Europe. As the crusades and inquisitions rooted out all challenges of Rome one by one. Not even centuries of both Chalcedonian and Serbian Orthodox Church persecution have managed to defeat them, as Bosnian Church flourishes to this day, it will continue its studies of long forgotten texts."
 empower_bosnian_nobility_desc:0 "History of medieval Bosnia has been one of everlasting balance between its rulers and their nobles. Pressured from the outside by both Rome and Hungary eager to conquer Bosnian lands, rulers of Bosnia have had to proclaim themselves nominally Chalcedonian, in order to prevent crusades against their domains. But at the same time virtually all of their nobility remained loyal to the indigenous and to both Rome and Serbian Orthodox Church - heretical Bosnian Church. This meant that ruling Bosnia was a perpetual game of balance, one that only masters of this game could play and live to tell. In this game of thrones, you either win or you die."

 archbishop_of_athens_desc:0 "The seat of Archbishop of Athens was one of the most culturally distinct archbishoprics of the Chalcedonian Church. Especially after the fall of the Latin Empire.

Even as voices in the dark corridors of Rome whisper rumors of the archbishopric's dissolution, we will stand firm in our faith and resolve."
 albanian_tolerance_desc:0 "Due to Turbulence in the region, the lands and peoples of Albania have found themselves ruled by many different overlords.

Eager to fight back Chalcedonian communities have also begun to propagate for a Slovak written language of their own. While this religious schism looks like it will split our society for some time their determination will ensure that the Slovak language will soon be as literary as any other Slavic tongue. We must do what we can to strengthen this development for the benefit of Slovak people."
