 mainlore_events.3.t:"The City of Art Hadra"
 mainlore_events.3.desc:"In 600 BCE, the Phoenicians arrived at the Hadra Peninsula on the continent of Atlantis and established the city of Art Hadra. This made Art Hadra the first urban center on the continent. As the city developed, it quickly became a major trading center on Atlantis. The Phoenicians introduced their own products, such as ceramics, glass, and metal objects, as well as spices and luxury goods from other countries that they acquired during their travels. Art Hadra became an important port for Phoenician ships, which set sail from the city to other parts of the world, establishing a widespread trade network. In addition to its role as a trading center, Art Hadra was also an important cultural and religious hub. The Phoenicians introduced their own beliefs and rituals to the city, and established institutions such as temples, schools, and religious clubs. Art Hadra became a center for learning and the arts, with many notable artists, scholars, and philosophers coming to share their ideas and discoveries. Over the centuries, Art Hadra flourished and became one of the most important cities on the continent of Atlantis. The Phoenicians were proud of their heritage and preserved their traditions, but at the same time were open to the influences of other cultures and were eager to make contact with other nations. As a result, Art Hadra became a place of many meetings and exchanges of ideas, which contributed to the further development and progress of the city."

 mainlore_events.4.t:"Discover of America"
 mainlore_events.4.desc:"In 400 BCE, Art Hadra became the perfect base for the Phoenicians' greatest achievement: the discovery of a sea route to Anhuac, known in our world as America. The expedition was not easy, as the winds were treacherous, storms were destructive, and sea monsters were unpredictable. Finally, in 3058 (in our calendar, 428 BCE), the Phoenicians arrived in the vicinity of Venezuela. The journey to Anhuac was not without its challenges. The Phoenicians faced many dangers on the open sea, and many of their ships and crew members were lost along the way. Despite these risks, the Phoenicians were determined to explore the unknown and to discover new lands, and their bravery and ingenuity helped them to succeed in their quest This achievement was a major milestone for the Phoenicians and for Art Hadra, as it opened up new trading routes and opportunities for the city. The Phoenicians were able to establish a trade network with the peoples of Anhuac, exchanging their own products for valuable goods such as gold, silver, and exotic crops.  Trade with the countries in Anhuac developed at an incredible pace, thanks to the Phoenicians. As a result of these contacts, horses were introduced to America and corn and tomatoes were introduced to Europe. The presence of horses led to a rapid technological development in America, which would have unforeseen consequences in the future. The Phoenicians' discovery of a sea route to Anhuac and the resulting trade relations had a significant impact on the world. It opened up new markets and opportunities for the Phoenicians and other civilizations, and facilitated the exchange of ideas, technologies, and cultural influences. However, the rapid development of technology and trade also had its drawbacks. The demand for exotic goods and resources led to conflicts and competition between different nations, and some civilizations began to exploit the resources of other regions for their own gain."
 mainlore_events.4.a:"Legacy of Discovery"
 mainlore_events.5.t:"Legacy of Discovery"
 mainlore_events.5.desc:"Meanwhile, the Phoenician state itself began to decline due to external factors. Atlantis itself became a site of active colonization by Greek settlers. When the original Phoenicia fell, a new kingdom of Phoenicia was established in Art Hadra, which continues to exist to this day. The rise of this new kingdom of Phoenicia in Art Hadra was a significant event in the history of the region. The Phoenicians, who had always been a maritime people, had lost their original homeland and were looking for a new place to call home. Art Hadra, with its rich history and cultural traditions, provided a perfect place for the Phoenicians to rebuild their civilization. Over time, the sea route to Anhuac itself was forgotten, and contact with the countries on the other side was lost for almost 1500 years. The reasons for this are not entirely clear, but it is possible that the loss of the Phoenician homeland and the rise of other civilizations may have contributed to the decline of the sea route. It is also possible that the journey itself was too difficult and risky, and that other trade routes and technologies became more attractive to merchants and travelers. Despite the loss of contact, the legacy of the Phoenicians and their journey to Anhuac lived on. The exchange of ideas, technologies, and cultural influences that had taken place during their time in Anhuac had a lasting impact on the world, and many of the innovations and ideas that the Phoenicians had introduced continued to be developed and spread by other civilizations. Eventually, the sea route to Anhuac was rediscovered, and contact with the countries on the other side was reestablished. The history of the Phoenicians and their journey to Anhuac became a source of fascination and inspiration for generations to come, and their legacy continued to shape the world in ways that no one could have imagined."

 mainlore_events.301.t:"The Horizon Signal"
 mainlore_events.301.desc:"It was the year 6721, and Europe was in turmoil due to the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire, caused by the Fourth Crusade, while the Holy Roman Empire was in the midst of a civil war between supporters of the Emperor and the Pope. In addition, on the distant East, the steppe tribes had united and were preparing for major conquests. In these dire circumstances, bad news was reaching from Atlantis: the Aztec state, known as the Obsidian Empire, had rediscovered the old sea route from Europe to Anhuac. The rediscovery of the sea route by the Aztecs was a major event, and it had the potential to change the balance of power in the world. The Aztecs were a powerful and ambitious civilization, and they had already established a vast empire in Anhuac. With the sea route open, they could easily transport their armies and resources to Europe, potentially threatening the stability and prosperity of the continent. The news of the Aztec sea route caused great concern in Europe, and many feared that it could lead to a new wave of invasions and conquests. Some called for a crusade against the Aztecs, while others sought diplomatic solutions or formed alliances with other civilizations to counter the threat. It was unclear how the situation would unfold, but one thing was certain: the rediscovery of the sea route to Anhuac had the potential to change the course of history."

 mainlore_events.302.t:"The Great Atlantic War"
 mainlore_events.302.desc:"The fears of many turned out to be true, as the first contacts between the Atlantis Empire and the Obsidian Empire were cold. However, no one expected the ferocity of the Aztec army. In 6723, 100,000 Aztec soldiers landed on the continent of Atlantis, quickly conquering such cities as Art Hadra, Agadhr, Fraburg, and Koloneia. The Aztec invasion of Atlantis was a major event that shook the world. The Aztecs were a formidable military power, and their rapid conquest of the continent came as a surprise to many. The Atlantis Empire was caught off guard, and it struggled to respond to the threat. Many of the cities and civilizations on Atlantis were unable to withstand the Aztec assault, and they fell to the invaders. However, after a 5-year war called the Great Atlantic War, the Atlantis Empire and the Phoenicians were able to recapture most of the cities on the continent. However, the Aztecs retained control of the territories of Atlaria, where they established a new Aztec Kingdom, Acaltetlnacayomimiq. The Great Atlantic War was a devastating conflict that claimed many lives and caused widespread destruction. The Atlantis Empire and the Phoenicians were determined to defend their homes and their way of life, and they mobilized their armies and resources to resist the Aztec invasion. The Aztecs, in turn, were determined to maintain their control of the continent, and they fought fiercely to hold on to their conquests. Despite the end of the war, tensions between the Aztecs and the other civilizations of Atlantis remained. The Aztecs were seen as oppressors by many, and there were frequent uprisings and protests against their rule. However, over time, the two sides learned to coexist, and trade and cultural exchange between them helped to build bridges and reduce the tensions. The legacy of the Great Atlantic War would shape the region for centuries to come, and it would have a lasting impact on the world."

 mainlore_events.303.t:"The Sunset Invasion"
 mainlore_events.303.desc:"As it turned out, the Atlantic War was only a prelude to the Aztecs' main invasion of Europe, known as the Sunset Invasion. This invasion was the largest military landing in history, with nearly 200,000 Aztec soldiers landing on the beaches of the Kingdom of Iberiacum. Within just 5 days, their fleet had captured Lisbon, marking the beginning of the bloodiest conflict of the European Middle Ages. The Sunset Invasion was a major turning point in the history of Europe, and it had far-reaching consequences for the continent and the world. The Aztecs were a formidable military power, and their conquest of Europe was swift and decisive. Many of the European nations were unable to withstand the Aztec assault, and they fell to the invaders. During the first months of the invasion, Aztec forces were able to conquer the entire territory of Andalusia. The Aztec occupation was extremely bloody and brutal, and strange structures resembling pyramids were built on the conquered lands for the purpose of human sacrifice. However, the Aztecs, who were unfamiliar with the terrain, made a strategic error by sending their soldiers into the Kingdom of Mauretania, expecting to find the main Christian cities there. This gave the Europeans enough time to organize the so-called Great Crusade, which was aimed at defending Christianity. The Great Crusade was a major event in the history of Europe, and it brought together many of the Christian nations of the continent in a common cause. The Europeans were determined to defend their faith and their way of life, and they mobilized their armies and resources to resist the Aztec invasion."

 mainlore_events.304.desc:"The most important point of the invasion was the Battle of Labour, in which 60,000 Crusaders, led by King Casimir the Pious of Venice, defeated a 100,000-strong Aztec army. The victory at Labour effectively ended the Aztec offensive and forced them to adopt a defensive posture. The Battle of Labour was a decisive turning point in the conflict, and it had far-reaching consequences for both sides. The Aztecs were stunned by the defeat, and they were forced to retreat to their strongholds in Andalusia. The Europeans, on the other hand, were emboldened by their victory, and they began a series of counteroffensives to retake the territories that had been conquered by the Aztecs. Despite the victory at Labour, Iberia remained under the occupation of the Aztec Kingdom of Ueyitlan, which continued to pursue a policy of genocide against the Iberian peoples. The Aztecs were determined to maintain their control of the region, and they used brutal tactics to suppress any resistance. The situation in Iberia was dire, and many of the native peoples were desperate for deliverance. They looked to the other European nations for help, and they appealed to them to come to their aid and drive out the Aztecs. The other European nations responded to the call for help, and they mobilized their armies to recoqnuer Iberia. The Reconquest of Iberia was a long and difficult process, and it required the combined efforts of many nations. However, after years of fighting, the Aztecs still finally driven out of Iberia, and the native peoples were able to reclaim their lands."

 mainlore_events.305.t:"The Reconquista"
 mainlore_events.305.desc:"The Reconquista of Iberia is a long and difficult process, and it required the combined efforts of many Christian nations. Despite the liberation efforts, three Aztec kingdoms still exist on the Iberian Peninsula: the Kingdom of Atlahuitl, Kingdom of Yaocallibaal, and Kingdom of  Murrethlan. These kingdoms have managed to maintain their independence, and they continue to resist the efforts of the Europeans to conquer them. The Aztecs in these kingdoms have been able to hold on to their power and their way of life, and they have maintained their cultural traditions. However, they are surrounded by hostile European powers, and they are constantly under threat of attack. The Aztecs in these kingdoms are a reminder of the past, and they represent the enduring legacy of the Sunset Invasion. They are a testament to the resilience of the Aztec civilization, and they are a reminder of the power and influence that it once had in Europe. Despite their small size and their isolated position, the Aztec kingdoms on the Iberian Peninsula continue to play a significant role in the history and culture of the region."
