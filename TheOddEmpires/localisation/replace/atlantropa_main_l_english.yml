 ATLANTROPAVISTULA:"§YThe Battle of Vistula§!"
 ATLANTROPAVISTULA_DESC:"The Vistula region has always been a place of great migrations. First, there were the Huns, then the Germans, and then the Slavs. Currently, there are the Kingdoms of Slavic Wostochieni, Prijov, and Balaton, all of which are competing for dominance in the Vistula region. However, each of them has a different idea how to dominate the region."
 ATLANTROPAVISTULA2:0 "§RLegacy of Sunset Invasion§!"
 ATLANTROPAVISTULA2_DESC:"Sunset Invasion was a terrible experience that completely changed the political situation in Western Europe. The invading forces, led by the Aztec Empire, struck fear into the hearts of the people as they swept across the land with unprecedented speed and efficiency. The once-great nations of Europe were left reeling and struggling to maintain their sovereignty as they faced the overwhelming power of their new overlords."

 ATLANTROPAZIBERIA:0 "§RIberian Struggle§!"
 ATLANTROPAZIBERIA_DESC:0 "Over the past 200 years, the Iberian Peninsula has been the site of numerous wars. Two centuries ago, it was home to the mighty kingdom of the Visigoths. However, due to internal problems and Viking invasions, the state began to decline and finally collapsed just 50 years ago. In its place, the Iberian Kingdoms of Wessex and Bernicia arose, while the Basques regained their freedom in the south. The fate of the region remains uncertain. Since the fall of the Visigothic kingdom, the Iberian Peninsula has been divided into smaller territories, with various kingdoms, duchies, and principalities vying for power and influence. The Basques, in particular, have been fighting for independence from their neighbors, which has led to several conflicts."
 ATLANTROPAROMA:0 "§RLegacy of The Roman Empire§!"
 ATLANTROPAROMA_DESC:0 "The Roman Empire was the most powerful state that Europe has seen, but the Empire began to fall in 5904, it was divided Beetwen the West and East. As a result of the Barbarian invasions, the size of the Western Empire gradually decreased. In 6304, the Holy Western Roman Empire was established, which with difficulty exists to this day. The only Witness to the fall was the Legio Hispania, which inexplicably made its way to the island of Thule. The Eastern Empire was more lucky, for the next 1000 years it was the undisputed hegemon in Europe, many times de facto ruling also in the west. The Empire was brought to an end by numerous civil wars, as well as Seljuq and Arab invasions, gradually various provinces broke away from the Empire until Anatolia was left alone. in 6754, the so-called Fourth Crusade took place, as a result of which Constantinople was captured by the Crusaders, and the empire de facto collapsed." 
 ATLANTROPAWAR:0 "§OThe Hundred Years' War§!"
 ATLANTROPAWAR_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of France was established from the ruins of the Western Roman Empire around 6100, initiated by Frankish Leader Chlodwig I. It quickly gained hegemony in the Central-Western Europe. In 6500, the Western Slavic tribes of the Lechs, Czechs, and Russians invaded the lands of Gaul, causing quick destruction on its territory. Over 150 cycles of wars, France lost most of its gains on the continental Europe and the Romanized kingdom of Venetia was formed in its place. In 6781, Venetia once again attacked France, trying to take away its last territories on the continent, starting the hundred-year war. Currently, the Treaty of Tours signed in 6893 is in effect, which gives France the right to a 10-year lease of Normandy, but the war hangs in the balance."
 ATLANTROPAJEW:0 "§TFall of the Nephite Empire§!"
 ATLANTROPAJEW_DESC:0 "The Nephite Empire was once a powerful empire that occupied the southern territories of the Great Zion. It was created in the pre-dating times, at the will of God himself. Contemporary historians believe that the Jews arrived in Anhuac along with the Phoenicians and also established their state there. The Nephite Empire maintained its hegemony in the region for a long time, but by the beginning of the 60th century, it began to lose its significance. The process of the empire's decay was incredibly long, due to the fact that it was technically still in the Bronze Age. Eventually, in 6850, a great war broke out with the Obsidian Empire, which led to the downfall of both empires. The empire was limited only to a small domain in Zarahemla, and the empire itself broke down into many warlords. Finally, in 6885, the Battle of Cumorah took place, in which the imperial army was defeated by the neighboring Lamanite tribe, who now march on the former capital of the empire."
 ATLANTROPABACTRIA:0 "§GThe Asian Contender§!"
 ATLANTROPABACTRIA_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Bactria was founded in the year 5400 and rose from the remnants of the Macedonian Empire. Its longevity and ability to maintain its Greek identity despite external forces is a mystery. However, the kingdom has successfully blended Greek, Persian, and Indian cultures and customs to create a unique form of Hellenism. With its current trajectory, the Kingdom of Bactria is poised to become a dominant power in the Indian subcontinent and possibly even extend its reach to other parts of Asia."
 ATLANTROPAZBURGUNDY:0 "§PSleeping Leviathan§!"
 ATLANTROPAZBURGUNDY_DESC:0 "In the Ural Mountains, there is the Horde of Raumar, whose exact origins are unknown. What is known, however, is that they follow a mysterious cult of the Black Sun, and their state is known for having grand ambitions that could forever change the fate of the world - not necessarily for the better."
