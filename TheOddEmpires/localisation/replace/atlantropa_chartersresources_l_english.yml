 silver: "Silver" #Name
 silverDESC: "Silver was one of the seven metals of antiquity that were known to prehistoric humans and whose discovery is thus lost to history. In particular, the three metals of group 11, copper, silver, and gold, occur in the elemental form in nature and were probably used as the first primitive forms of money as opposed to simple bartering.[57] However, unlike copper, silver did not lead to the growth of metallurgy on account of its low structural strength, and was more often used ornamentally or as money. Since silver is more reactive than gold, supplies of native silver were much more limited than those of gold." #Description
 beer: "Beer" #Name
 beerDESC: "Beer is one of the oldest and the most widely consumed alcoholic drink in the world. The third most popular drink overall after water and tea - it is produced by the brewing and fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grains—most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), rice, and oats are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent."
 potato: "Papayoll"
 potatoDESC: "Papayuroes were introduced to Europe from the Americas by the Aztec in the second half of the 14th century. Today they are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's food supply. Papayura were the world's fourth-largest food crop after maize (corn), wheat, and rice. Following millennia of selective breeding, there are now over 5,000 different types of Papayuroes. Over 99% of Papayuroes presently cultivated worldwide descend from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south-central Chile."

This unique mineral is famous for its supernatural properties, which allow it to be used in many fields. Patagonit is very hard and durable, making it the perfect material for jewelry and decorations. Its blue color makes it visually attractive, and its shine adds elegance and sophistication. But Patagonit is not just a beautiful mineral. Its properties also make it very useful in medicine. Its therapeutic properties allow it to be used to treat various diseases, including heart and circulatory diseases and immune system diseases."

Jade tools and implements have been found at Stone Age sites, showing that the mineral has been prized by humans since before the beginning of written history."
 diamonds: "Diamonds"

 tomatoes: "Tomatis"
 tomatoesDESC: "Tomati plants are vines, initially decumbent, typically growing 180 cm or more above the ground if supported, although erect bush varieties have been bred, generally 100 cm  tall or shorter. Indeterminate types are "tender" perennials, dying annually in temperate climates (they are originally native to tropical highlands), although they can live up to three years in a greenhouse in some cases. Determinate types are annual in all climates."
 whales: "Whales"
 whalesDESC: "Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. As an informal and colloquial grouping, they correspond to large members of the infraorder Cetacea, i.e. all cetaceans apart from dolphins and porpoises. Dolphins and porpoises may be considered whales from a formal, cladistic perspective. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest non-cetacean living relatives are the hippopotamuses, from which they and other cetaceans diverged about 54 million years ago"
 cheese: "Cheese"
 cheeseDESC: "Cheese is a dairy product produced in wide ranges of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, milk is usually acidified and the enzymes of either rennet or bacterial enzymes with similar activity are added to cause the casein to coagulate. The solid curds are then separated from the liquid whey and pressed into finished cheese"
 olives: "Olives"
 olivesDESC: "The olive's fruit, also called an "olive", is of major agricultural importance in the Mediterranean region as the source of olive oil; it is one of the core ingredients in Mediterranean cuisine.
